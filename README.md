# Office-PDF-converter
 This container will create an instance of windows with the full MS Office suite, and convert any word document or presentation file to PDF with the option of extracting the text.


Many conversion methods fail to support a large variety of Microsoft Word features.  Using Microsoft Word to script the conversion of files will allow greater language support and a more accurate positioning representation for floating shapes, images, and text boxes (compare pages 4 and 8 of the algorithm PDFs).
